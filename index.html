        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>Hello! Welcome to my blog where I bicker, squabble, and pratter about the projects I work on between IT experiments and raiding in MMORPG's.</p>
        <p>I'm a student of MSc Human Computer Interaction at UCL, England. My first degree was in Anthropology and my interests lie between the two and thereabouts. With this, I am experienced in qualitative and quantitative user research methods, data vis., indie game dev., and infosec.
        This website serves in part as a portfolio, a personal blog, and a playground for various ideas and experiments. I will continuously update it with content of both the past and the present over time.</p>
        <h1>My goals</h1>
        <p>While I'm working towards my HCI degree I'm also training myself in entry-level cyber security <b>with an aim to start a career in SOC (Security Operations Centre)</b> by the time I finish.
          Instead of jumping into something like network+ or security+ right away, I've been playing about with a VMware homelab and a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) on my own. This should help me build a foundation of knowledge and form a thorough understanding of the system whereas certifications tend to teach you a bunch of tricks that you can repeat on the terminal.
          I will contribute my findings to this blog as I undergo experimentation and am able to form a comprehensive understanding of my actions and results.</p>
	<h1>Hobbies</h1>
	<p>I'm also an avid MMORPG player and high-end raiding is a great hobby of mine. Specifically, I play and raid in Lost Ark and Final Fantasy XIV. Raid content is developed and released continuously for both of these MMORPG's and is incredibly challenging to play, often requiring weeks of attempts and progression to complete. 
	I will detail my raiding exploits in this blog as I begin and progress through these various team-based battles. It will be constituted of a mix of guide information and discussion.</p>
